Individual task in 9103 Creative coding major project - Perlin noise and randomness

Instructions:
Load the page, click the button or change the page size, and wait for the image to be generated. According to the original code, it takes approximately five seconds. The waiting time will vary depending on the number of line groups and the painting speed.

Key features:
Iterations (in Iterations.js): This individual task was adapted from the group task using perlin noise. On the basis of the original visual effect, perlin noise was applied to add variations in light and shade to the lines, creating a "breathing" effect.

Final sketch (in sketch.js): This individual task was adapted from the group task using perlin noise. On the basis of the original visual effect, perlin noise was applied to add disturbing effect.
